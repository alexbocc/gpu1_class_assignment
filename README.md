# tensor.hpp
	I created this to have a nice interface for multidimensional matrices: when I have to access the element of a 3D matrix I want just to have to write mat(i, j, k).

# genMatrix.cpp
	I use this for creating random matrices. To compile: `clang++ -std=c++14 genMatrix.cpp -o genMatrix`. To create a 2048x2048 random matrices you have to run: `genMatrix 2048x2048 > outfile`

# test2D.cpp
	I implemented here 2D*2D matrix multiplication with blocking. I just learnt here the block multiplication.
